"""
Re-create an attribute chart from a textbook example.

From "Managing Quality: Integrating the Supply Chain" by S. Thomas Foster, 5th
edition, re-create Example 12-1 based on the data provided in the table on page
316.

The resulting chart should show that the process is not in control.

Note that using control charts to monitor the outcome of court cases, as Foster
does in this example, seems ethically questionable.
