"""
Re-create an XÌ… and R chart from a textbook example.

From "Managing Quality: Integrating the Supply Chain" by S. Thomas Foster, 5th
edition, re-create Figure 11-8 based on the sample measurements provided in the
table on page 287.

The resulting plot will show an out-of-control mean in the third sample and two
out-of-control ranges at samples 22 and 25.
